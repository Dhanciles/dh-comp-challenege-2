# Static Comp #2

###### For my second static comp of the module I have recreated a website for a comedy club based on the comp that was given. 
###### The website displays some of my favorite comedians and what would be a fantasy lineup of headliners for a week between July 22nd - July 29th. 
###### The color scheme was based on the comp given to me and other primary colors are playing off of the Laugh Factory's logo. 
###### Below are photos of the original comp given and the website I created.
